# AMW:
# IMPORTANT: you can't test anything in this repo that depends on tools from outside it!
# Because this file includes rif.hash it can't be run through pyrosetta_tests
# I have to stub it out in order to get my material into master -- do please update this
# script so that the testing server can run it.
# Meantime, feel free to use earlier commits of pyrosetta_scripts.
