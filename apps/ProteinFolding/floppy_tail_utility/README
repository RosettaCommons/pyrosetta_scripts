#better documentation written by the people who made these scripts should go here
#This README file was made by Alex Payne, a research assistant in Brian Kuhlman's lab.
#Alex is also responsible for copying this directory from /Rosetta/main/source/scripts/PyRosetta/public/floppy_tail_utility
#Feel free to improve the documentation and remove my name completely.
#but for the time being:

These are scripts intended to be used in conjunction with FloppyTail.

FloppyTail is a Rosetta application written by Steven Lewis.
It was intended to be used to model 'floppy' termini and loops in crystal structures with missing density.
These PyRosetta scripts are intended to make it easier to use FloppyTail.
